# Search-Algorithm-Analysis
to study the behavior of search algorithms across various sets of inputs using a technique called Monte Carlo analysis

## What is Monte Carlo Algorithm 

Monte Carlo analysis involves subjecting a system to random input perturbations in order to see how it responds 
across a wide variety of inputs. For this Repository my purpose is to focus on studying how the average number of operations of three 
search algorithms varies across a collection of randomly generated data sets.Specifically, I will be analyzing 
linear search, binary search, and interpolation search in terms of the average number of operation seach algorithm 
performson average over a series of data sets.
